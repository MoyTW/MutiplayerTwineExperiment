<h1>Answers</h1>\
<strong>1) Who killed Marlon Brando? (9 points)</strong>

Marlon Brando was killed by James Dean.

<strong>2) Why was Marlon Brando killed? (5 points)</strong>

Marlon Brando was killed because James Dean was selling Project STORM data to Rasputin. Brando intended to arrest him with General Labienus, but Dean became suspicious and ambushed him before his meeting.

<strong>3) Was there a security breach in Project STORM? If so, what was its nature, and who was involved? (5 points)</strong>

Yes. As stated above, James Dean, who had access to Project STORM data, was selling it to Rasputin. They met the evening of the murder at First Connection and swapped briefcases.

<strong>4) What was Brando's note about First Connection about? (3 points)</strong>

It was a handwritten copy of a note that he'd intercepted from Rasputin, telling James Dean to meet him to do the swap.

<strong>5) Was General Labienus involved, and if so, how? (3 points)</strong>

Yes, but not actively. He was contacted by Marlon Brando and agreed to a meeting, but had no more involvement than that.
