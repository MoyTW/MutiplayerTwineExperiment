* R & Z Testing
+ Z's first link click brought up a dictionary (?) - is that the Mac dictionary
  search gone mad?
+ Players decided to literally read the whole thing out loud (even the shared
  parts)
  - I don't think anybody has done that before!
+ Oh, hey, a typo - it says they have 7 turns. Check the rules screen for typos,
  I guess. Also Z had a pause there - also a typo?
+ "Oh it forks! We're doing it separately!"
+ Oh NOW they've stopped reading it.
+ Z's sidebar is dying horribly, somehow! Refreshing seems to have solved it.
  - Good to know my code for syncing state seems mostly functional.
+ Hahaha, Z's suspicious of Horace & Horace's Mother (because who sends their
  secretaries' mothers gifts, basically nobody)
+ I think that in this format, having betrayal points could work really well! Or
  putting in action or other sorts of things into the various pages.
+ huh that inconsistency about meeting/non meeting seems far too subtle!
+ People & Places seems universally well-received, definitely great.
+ Oh no there's a bug!
  - There's some sort of sync bug that they fixed by reloading?
  - Oh, the network lag got them - argh, okay. Yeah I should update the client
    proactively. It won't necessarily fix lag, but...
+ Huuuuuh! Hilariously, R went to First Connection and Z went to Rasputin, and
  it looks like...the info conveyed was...huh! Let me reread my passage - it
  sounds like R thought that BRANDO was in the bar.
+ Hmm they're continually expecting more respnsiveness from the game than exists
  (for example, since they talked to Hepburn they should be able to see the
  tapes)
  - Wait, what, did I mess up the timing and schedule Marie & Jocelyn's dinners
    over each other?
  - Also no you cannot tell Jocelyn about Marie, game is not NEARLY so
    responsive.
+ People (reasonably) keep thinking Tarita is involved.
+ People KEEP CLICKING THROUGH, hahaha.
+ They completely missed, huh? due to the difficulty inherent in summarizing, I
  guess.
* D & K Testing
+ Some notes about itch.io - I changed it to fullscreen on click on the itch.io
  site
+ In Ch1_CaseIntro2 D noted that it was unclear who was Hortensia; writing
  crtique
+ Maybe I should explicitly call out the People & Places button (also see R & Z)
+ Typo "invited too his Christmas ball."
+ Hahaha, I have the 7 turns typo still in apparently!
+ Huh, they wanted to interview the children, haha.
+ They're definitely going hard on the thinking (to the point where they're
  questioning who wrote the notebook)
+ "The historical Marlon Brando was an ass!" hahahahaHA
+ Some slight discussion between the two about whether to read out to each other
  or copy or whatever
  - See, that's coming back to the "totally transparent" style of cooperative
    game design...
+ Huh! That's some sorta bug! He got into the action screen & it popped him back
  into the Select your Action screen. Maybe network failure?
  - HUH. Okay, there's some sort of replay bug going on where it boots them back
    to the previous screen after they went into the clue point.
  - wtf I can't reproduce it on my end, argh
  - no, seriously, let's see if it keeps happening
+ D's showing his Game Literacy now
  - K's also very into it
  - Wow these two are really good at this!? relative to, like, everybody else!?
+ Everybody thinks the James Dean bills scene is weird, haha.
+ Huh, Dean never actually states that he met Brando on the day of the murder!
  Hahaha! Well, sure, I mean, that's fair enough.
+ "Where's forensics?" *bangs table* "I need forensics!"
+ Funny dialogue about the First Connection note "Did Grigori Rasputin write
  this!?" hahaha! okay that's immensely amusing
  - To be fair the explanation for the notebook is hilariously awful in the
    Consulting Detective case
  - You know...it's actually hilarious to think that the notebook is Rasputin's
+ It snapped K back to the scene again
  - Argh, what the heck!?
  - I can't seem to reproduce any of this!
  - I wonder if their internets are worse?
+ People keep wanting to Ask Person About Other Thing, haha...
+ I should add a "Your People & Places has been updated!" or something.
+ Huh, they're settling on "Dean deffo did it" but they're unsure about Pollio's
  involvement in the whole thing (whether Dean or Pollio did the drop)
  - Oh the original had both the bar people having briefcases, I apparently
    forgot to write that Dean had one. RIP.
+ Impressions
  - paper books are super easy to cheat
  - multiplayerness?
    - different from SHCD in multiplayerness
    - it's Pandemic multiplayerness
    - D wonders if asking the player to NOT read full text would be better
    - partial information
      - chat-based online escape room where chat messages were corrupted - other
        players did not receive the whole message, only got first two words!
      - click on sentences to verbatim push to the other player, and limit how
        much to do?
    - Small World?
